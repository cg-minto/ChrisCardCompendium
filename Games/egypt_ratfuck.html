        <h2>How to Play</h2>

        <h2>Customising Combos</h2>
        
        <p>There is a bunch of combos to choose from, Its probably best new players should start with only the first 3 combos in play and add more as you get comfortable with the game. If you want an extra twist, have the winning player of each round choose which combo to add.</p>
